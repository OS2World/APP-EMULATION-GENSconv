This is the OS/2 port of GENSconv, a HiSoft GENS source converter for ZX Spectrum
DEVPac users.

For those of you who don't know what it is (well, you sure aren't Speccy fans :) ),
DEVPAC is known worldwide as the best assembler for the old and beloved Sinclair
ZX Spectrum.

These two programs can convert a DEVPAC source file into a normal txt file and
backwards, so that it's now possible to edit directly the assembly source on your
OS/2 system and make it DEVPAC-readable. Or, viceversa, turn a DEVPAC source into
a txt file which you can read on your OS/2 machine.

Consult the README file for more informations.

I built it with GCC 4.5.2 and Paul Smedley's build environment, so if you find it
useful or even funny, please consider making him a donation for his hard work on
allowing us to have more modern OS/2 applications.

Sources are included if you want to recompile them on another platform.

Have fun with ZX Spectrum emulation!
